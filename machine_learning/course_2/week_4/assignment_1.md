1. What is the absolute value of the learned coefficient of feature power_1? (Remove any sign.) Round your answer to 2 decimal places, and use American-style decimals. Example: 100.32

**410.29**

2. For the models learned in each of these training sets, what are the smallest value you learned for the coefficient of feature power_1? Choose the range that contains this value.

**Between -1,000 and -100**


3. For the models learned in each of these training sets, what are the largest value you learned for the coefficient of feature power_1? Choose the range that contains this value.

**Between 1,000 and 10,000**

4. For the models learned with the high level of regularization in each of these training sets, what are the smallest value you learned for the coefficient of feature power_1? Round your answer to 2 decimal places, and use American-style decimals. Example: 2.11

**1.91**

5. For the models learned with the high level of regularization in each of these training sets, what are the largest value you learned for the coefficient of feature power_1? Round your answer to 2 decimal places, and use American-style decimals. Example: 2.11

**2.59**

6. What is the best value for the L2 penalty according to 10-fold validation?

**100**
**10^2.5 = 316.227766017**
*10^3.5 = 3162.277660168*
(incorrect)

**Between 1e15 and 3e15**
**Between 4e14 and 6e14**
**Between 6e14 and 8e14**
(incorrect)
